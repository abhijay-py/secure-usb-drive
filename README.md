Our device has a fixed number of four users. When the user enters the correct password on the keypad or enters the correct fingerprint, they get to access the files corresponding to their user. <br>

Initially, all the users’ passwords are four zeros. When the user plugs in the USB drive, the LCD screen says, "Select User" and they must enter a number on the keypad to select the user (1 for user one, 2 for user two, 3 for user three, and 4 for user four). Then the LCD screen shows “Enter Passcode / Fingerprint” and the screen displays what the user types on the keypad. As the user types, their input is replaced with a dot. Once the user enters the correct passcode or inputs the correct fingerprint, the USB drive goes into the unlocked state where all the files for that user can be accessed. Each user gets their own designated flash chip. In the unlocked state, the user can press a button on the keypad to change the passcode or change the fingerprint and can press another button to lock the USB drive.<br>

The system is implemented using an STM32 microcontroller. It handles interfacing with the keypad, LCD screen, fingerprint sensor, four flash chips, and a host computer. It also handles keeping track of what state it’s in and handles keeping track of what user is accessing the flash drive. The system is powered through the 5V USB signal that is interfaced with the 5V USB-A female connector. According to the USB 2.0 specifications, it can handle an input voltage ranging from 4.75V to 5.25V. This input voltage directly powers the LCD screen. There is a low dropout regulator to step down the voltage to 3.3V to power the microcontroller, fingerprint sensor, and the flash chips.The system is enclosed in a 3D-printed rectangular case. Since the user must press down on the USB drive to enter a password, it can be connected to a computer using a cable instead of directly into a computer. <br>

All documentation, PCB, schematic, CAD, and software files can be found in their respective folders. <br>

The embedded code can be flashed onto the product by utilizing STM32CubeIDE and connecting an ST-Link and the five header pins on the PCB. The PCB is attached to the casing utilizing two screws on the inside and the casing is closed up with four screws. The connectors on the board will need to be attached to the LCD, fingerprint sensor, and keypad from the outside of the casing after feeding the connecting wires through the holes on the casing. <br><br>
